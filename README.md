# Cyber Threat Analysis
This project is dedicated to analyzing the Synthetic Cybersecurity Dataset for AI, a simulated collection of 20,000 rows that resemble real-world digital security incidents.
The primary goal of this repository is to perform a comprehensive data analysis on this dataset and present insightful dashboards to enhance our understanding of various cyber threats and improve AI models for threat detection and response strategies.

## About the Dataset
The Synthetic Cybersecurity Dataset for AI includes a wide range of common cyber threats, providing a rich testing ground for emerging AI security technologies. This dataset is designed to aid in training AI models to detect and react to digital security incidents effectively.

## Project Objectives
- Data Exploration: Thoroughly explore and understand the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, converting data types, and performing necessary transformations.
- Data Analysis: Conduct a detailed analysis to uncover significant insights about cyber threats.
- Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive and informative dashboards to visualize the results and key findings.
